      <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
      <h3>Apple</h3>
      <a href="apple.com/ipad/">Apple.com</a>
      <p>Apple uses visual heirarchy to draw your eye exactly where they want it to go. First you read the bold front
        heading text and then then your eye is drawn to the color elements on the page. Though there are few, their
        scarcity causes them to stand out. </p>

      <h2>White Space</h2>
      <h3>Olive Ave Jewelry</h3>
      <a href="https://www.oliveavejewelry.com/collections/moissanite-rings">Olive Ave Jewelry</a>
      <p>This site uses white space to create clean lines, create a cohesive theme, and help the product stand out
        against the backround. </p>

      <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
      <h3>Joann</h3>
      <a href="https://www.joann.com/fabric/home-decor-fabric/">Joann Home Decor Fabric</a>
      <p>Because of the vast amount of products on Joann's website, having a clear way to shorten the browsing lists
        make it a lot easier for customers to find exactly what they are looking for. Hick's Law is followed as we learn
        that less options usually creates less chances of the customer getting overwhelmed and leaving. </p>
